# le_chiff_ble
A drop-in replacement for the beautiful le_chiffre
The PCB is working with all features. 
This is no easy project and I do not take responsibility for anything you make from the files supplied here. More documentation, pictures and descriptions will follow. 
A ZMK firmware exists and the encoder as well the OLEDs are working. Will be added later.
